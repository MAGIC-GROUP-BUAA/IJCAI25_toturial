                <p>Graph representation learning (GRL) has been extensively studied in both academia and industry. Essentially,  it maps high-dimensional features and complex structures of graphs into a low-dimensional space for effective  representation learning. However,  a fundamental and critical problem is that the complex topology renders the low-dimensional mapping process highly  sensitive to subtle changes in the data or the mapping process. Therefore,  we suggest that GRL is prone to <b>graph distortion</b>, i.e.,  the loss of information regarding the graph's intrinsic complex structure and topological properties. Graph distortion  manifests in three primary ways:  noisy and perturbed structure, missing and tampered topological properties,  and attribution fallacies in structural distribution. To address this significant issue,  low-distortion GRL seeks to preserve the fidelity of intrinsic graph properties throughout the representation learning  process. Low-distortion GRL has made great progress and attracted ever-increasing attention from the research community  in recent years.</p>
                
                <p>
                    This tutorial aims to disseminate and promote the recent research achievement in low-distortion GRL,  an exciting and fast-growing research direction within the broader fields of machine learning and artificial  intelligence. We offer unique insights into low-distortion GRL from <b>information theory, geometry,  and causality</b>. Specifically, we cover three major aspects, i.e., information-theoretic graph representation learning,  geometry-guided graph representation learning,  and invariance-guided graph representation learning. We will present novel, high-quality research findings,  as well as innovative solutions to the challenging problems in low-distortion GRL and its applications. Besides,  we will discuss future directions, such as advanced theories,  low-distortion approaches in graph large language models and graph foundation model,  and novel applications in AI for Science.
